## **CERTIFICATES** [Udacity Certificate Confirmation](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/KEUNUZPP), [DataCamp Data Analyst Associate](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DAA0013218523389)

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of the various data analysis projects that I have completed across numerous platforms and courses.

Throughout my journey to become a data analyst, I've honed my skills in cleaning and organizing data, identifying patterns and insights, drawing meaningful conclusions, and effectively communicating crucial findings. My experience spans across several volunteering projects, educational platforms and working on personal projects.

As a testament to my learning and growth, I've developed a strong proficiency in Python and its various data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) as well as SQL. Each project in this repository represents a piece of my portfolio and showcases the application of these skills.

A piece of advice for those delving into data science projects with Python: I highly recommend the installation of some essential libraries such as numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.

This repository is more than just a showcase of my workâ€”it's a testament to my ongoing learning journey in the dynamic field of data analysis. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, and even collaborate.
